# Fraud Detection Model for Mobile Money Transactions

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a fraud detection model for mobile money transactions using synthetic financial datasets. The model aims to identify fraudulent activities and enhance security in financial transactions.

## Stages of Development

### Initial Stage:
- **Data Gathering:** Collecting and understanding the dataset.
- **Implementation Planning:** Planning the approach and methodology.

### Middle Stage:
- **Explorative Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing data patterns and characteristics.
- **Feature Engineering & Selection:** Selecting and engineering features relevant to the model.
- **Physical Design:** Designing the model architecture and processing pipeline.

### Last Stage:
- **Development:** Building and training the model.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance.
- **Monitoring & Tuning:** Monitoring model performance and fine-tuning for optimal results.
- **Deployment:** Deploying the model for practical use.

## Dataset Used

- **Synthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection:** Generated by PaySim mobile money generator.
- **Source:** [Kaggle - PaySim Mobile Money Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1)

## Software & Tools

- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and analysis.
- **Common Libraries:** pandas (data manipulation), scikit-learn (model development), seaborn (visualization).

## Key Steps in Data Processing

- **Data Import & Validation:** Using `pd.read_csv` to load data and check its shape.
- **Data Cleaning:** Dropping irrelevant columns and treating categorical variables.
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Converting categorical data into numerical format.
- **Concatenation:** Combining data for comprehensive analysis.

## Model Development

- **Logistic Regression:** Used for building the prediction model.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** The model achieved a 99% prediction accuracy, primarily due to an imbalanced dataset.

## Visualizations

- **Confusion Matrix:** Shows the model's performance and accuracy.
- **Heatmap Plot:** Provides a visual representation of the confusion matrix with color coding for better interpretation.

## Conclusion

The model demonstrates high accuracy in predicting frauds, although the prediction rate is influenced by data imbalance. The visualizations highlight the model's tendency to classify most transactions as non-fraudulent.
